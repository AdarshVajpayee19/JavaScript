        <h3>Important Points about cookies.</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            cookies are small strings of data stored  directly in browser.
            In JavaScript, document.cookie provide access to cookie.
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            cookies are set by webServer using the set-cookie HTTP-Header. Next time when the request is sent to the same domain,
            <br>
            The browser sends the cookie Http-header.That way the server knows who sent the request.
            
            we can also access cookies using document.cookie property
            <hr>
            alert(document.cookie) --> contains key = value pairs delimited by a;
            <br>
            <h3>Writing to cookie </h3>
            An assignment to document.cookie is treated specially in a way that a write operation doesnt touch other cookies.
            <hr>
            document.cookie = "user=Adarsh" 
            it updates only cookie named user to adarsh.
            <h3>Cookie Options</h3>
            Cookie have several options which can be provided after key = value to a set call like this :
            <br>
            document.cookie = "user = blr;path=/a;expires = Tue,29 March 2024 03:18:22 GMT"
            <br>
            path options makes the cookie visible at /a ,/a/b etc...
            Expires sets Cookie expiration time.
