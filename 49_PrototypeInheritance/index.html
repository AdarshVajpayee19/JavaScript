    <h3>Prototype Inheritance</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>JavaScript objects have special property called prototype that is either null or references another object.
    </p><br>
    <center>Prototype object </center>
    <center>^</center>
    <center>|</center>
    <center>|</center>        
    <center>Object </center>

    <p>When we try to read a property from a prototype and its missing,JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype.This is Called as<b> "Prototype Inheritance."</b></p>
    <h3>setting Prototype</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We can Set Prototype by setting __proto__ Now if we read property from the object which is not in object and is present in the prototype,JavaScript will take it from prototype.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If we have a method in object, it is called from the object.If its missing in object and present in prototype, its is called from prototype.</p>
